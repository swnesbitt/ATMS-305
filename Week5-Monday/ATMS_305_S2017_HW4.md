Your homework will be collected from the following folder: `/data/atms305/a/netID/ATMS-305/Week5Answers`.  Place your final scripts for each problem, and the output of the scripts into that folder.  The script output, copied and pasted from the terminal can be saved in a file `Week5Answers.txt` in that directory.  Note each output with a header and footer, such as:
```

# Problems:

### 1. Sorting a dictionary, printing formatted values.

Write a python script to sort the annual-average global temperature anomaly values (contained in `aravg.ann.land_ocean.90S.90N.v4.0.1.201612.asc` in into a new dictionary in descending order.

To get the file:
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swnesbitt/ATMS-305/master/Week5-Monday/aravg.ann.land_ocean.90S.90N.v4.0.1.201612.asc
```

The script should print the top 10 warmest years to a file called 'top10warmest.txt', including all of the following information:

The output should look like this:
```
Ranking      Year     Temperature Anomaly (degrees C)      Temperature Anomaly (degrees F)
1.           1745     10.0                                 28.0
2. (etc.)
```

### 2. Seek and you shall find.

Use the Champaign hourly weather data contained in the file `CMI.csv` on github to answer the following questions.

To get the file:
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swnesbitt/ATMS-305/master/Week5-Monday/CMI.csv
```

Print the answers to the screen using a python script.

1. How many reports of snow (including the report SN, -SN, +SN) were there last year?
1. What fraction of the reports had snow reported?
1. What was the highest temperature last year, and when was it reported?
1. What was the mean temperature of all of the reports last year?
