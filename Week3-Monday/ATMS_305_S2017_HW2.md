# ATMS 305 Spring 2017 Homework 2  v1.0
## Due: 6 February 2017, 9:30 AM
Your homework will be collected from the following folder: `/data/atms305/a/netID/ATMS-305/Week3Answers`.  Place your final scripts for each problem, and the output of the scripts into that folder.  The script output, copied and pasted from the terminal can be saved in a file `Week3Answers.txt` in that directory.  Note each output with a header and footer, such as:
```
---------------------------------------------------------------
OUTPUT FROM PROBLEM 1
[PASTE TEXT HERE]
---------------------------------------------------------------
OUTPUT FROM PROBLEM 2
[PASTE TEXT HERE]
---------------------------------------------------------------
```
# Problems:
## 1. Command line arguments
Create a `bash` script that prints out each of the command line arguments passed to it, and the number of arguments.

## 2. Command substitution and Dates
Create a `bash` script which will take a filename as its first argument and create a Universal Time Coordinate (UTC) dated copy of the file. eg. if our file was named `file.txt` it would create a copy such as `2017-01-30_22:45:00_netID.txt`, where the date and your netID and time are determined from the current time *automatically*. (To achieve this you will probably want to play with command substitution, create variables from output from the command `date`)
